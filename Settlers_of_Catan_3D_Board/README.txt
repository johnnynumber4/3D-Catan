# Summary

For 2-4 Players:

Requires 312 5mm spherical magnets for the bases (12 for each resource tile [x19], 4 for each edge water [x18], 2 for each corner water[x6]). Ignore two of each resource and 1 desert. For instance, there are 6 Sheep resources, you only need 4 for the base game. Water tiles print as follows:
-Corner Harbor, Corner Water, Harbor1, and Harbor2 are printed 3 times.
-Water is printed 6 times.

For 5-6 players:

Requires 460 5mm spherical magnets for the bases (12 for each resource tile [x30], 4 for each edge water [x22], 2 for each corner water[x6]). Print all resources once. Water tiles print as follows:
-Corner Harbor, Corner Water, and Harbor2 are printed 3 times.
-Harbor1 is printed 5 times.
-Water is printed 8 times.

Note that this is not flush with most other boards/pieces here. The corner sections are larger and hexagonal. This allows the board to be backward compatible with the original wood road, cities, and settlements. If you want to print your own player pieces, each player will require the following:

-5 Settlements
-4 Citites
-15 Roads

The road corners and intersections are purely cosmetic, but 4 of each will generally work for most play throughs.
